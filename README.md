### 💡 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. in **Data Science and Applications** at IIT Madras, driven by a passion for creating intelligent, scalable, and explainable AI systems. I love digging deep into the **fundamentals** of Machine Learning — I’ve even coded ML models from scratch to understand every layer inside-out.

Whether it's **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, or deploying full-stack ML applications using **MLOps pipelines**, I thrive at the intersection of **math, code, and creativity**.

🧠 I believe in solving problems from first principles, and I’m obsessed with building AI that’s not just powerful but purposeful.

Currently, I’m seeking **internship opportunities** in **AI/ML, NLP, or MLOps** where I can bring value, collaborate with visionary teams, and grow rapidly 🚀
